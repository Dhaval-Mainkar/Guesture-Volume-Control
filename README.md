# Guesture-Volume-Control
Guesture Volume Control is a python program build with the of help of mediapipe and opencv. With GVC one can control the volume of its system with just two of his/her's fingers.
I recommend whomever is interested in this program one should go through Hand Tracking module first where many things like circles around the finger tip, the mid-point and as the name suggest hand tracking is performed using opencv and media pipe and later the same code is used with a little update for volume guesture control
